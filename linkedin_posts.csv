"I turned ONE winning ad into 100 high-performing variations—without lifting a finger.

Tired of wasting thousands testing creatives manually?

Sick of blowing $5k+ just to stumble on ONE ad that finally works?

Tired of chasing UGC creators who ghost after promising “revisions”?

We’ve all been there…

That’s why I built a self-sufficient AI agent that analyzes your ad to the smallest of detail, tells you what is working for your competitors and gives you suggestions based on the result —all on autopilot.

I’ve shared this with:

- 7 and 8-figure CPG brands
- Burnt-out media buyers stuck in creative fatigue
- Ecom stores struggling with creative testing

Their response?
“No way… this actually WORKS.”

Here’s how:

- Connect your social media pages
- The AI analyzes your creatives, compares with your competitors and gives you suggestions on optimisation

Result? You scale fast, minus the creative chaos.

Say goodbye to:
- Chasing freelancers for changes
- 3-week content delays
- Guesswork on ad angles
- Wasted budget on duds

Just repeatable, reliable scaling.

Comment 'SUPERADS' below, and I’ll shoot you a detailed report in your DMs (if we’re connected).

P.S. The last batch of people using this? They're now scaling past $50K/day. No joke. I turned ONE winning ad into 100 high-performing variations—without lifting a finger.

"As a 2-times $1M founder, 

These are the 5 Things I Wish I'd Known Sooner:

🎯 Nobody Cares About Your Cool Solution
Let's be honest - I spent way too long being excited about features nobody asked for. People don't buy ""nice-to-haves"" - they buy ""need-to-haves"" that make their problems go away. How painful is the problem that you are solving?

🔍 Get Picky About Who You Serve
I wasted months marketing to the wrong audience and burned cash and time through the process before getting it right. Find your ICP and refine it relentlessly until it's laser-precise. Don't even think about running ads until you've nailed exactly who you're talking to and confirmed they actually want what you're selling.

🌱 Fish Where The Fish Are Biting
Look, some prospects are ready to buy now, and some will never be ready. I wasted so much time on the wrong people! Focus on high-intent channels where you can grab the low-hanging fruit. One good customer who's ready to buy beats ten who ""might be interested someday.""

⏱️ Your Time Is Worth More Than You Think
This was a game-changer for me: before jumping into any task, I ask myself, ""Can I automate this? Can someone else do this?"" If you're doing $10/hour work when you could be doing $1,000/hour work, you're leaving money on the table.

🤖 AI Won't Save You (But It Can Help)
I got caught up in the AI hype too, buying tools I barely used, it’s not the answer to every question. Use AI to automate workflows and manual work to make more of your time. That's how I started building- to strike that balance. We use AI to get deep insights impossible for us to derive and to make efficient workflows, but we know it's the human touch that really makes marketing work. No robot can replace good content.

On a side note do you want to see what you're missing? My team is planning to offer a FREE Performance Review to a few companies that reach out to us. We combine AI insights with human expertise to analyse everything from details as minute as audio choices to even your influencer selection. We'll show you exactly how to make every marketing dollar count. Comment ‘SUPERADS’ below or connect with me for a conversation

Have a Good day!😊 As a 2-times $1M founder,

"All geared up for the new journey at Fuelgrowth with the Archits. 💁‍♀️ 

My love for solving and design thinking has led me to a journey of creating and shaping Fuego. Fuego is your AI Creative Designer, a perfect bridge brain between growth marketers and their control over the designed outcomes for the best performance.

I'm thrilled to announce that I'll now be sharing an exciting path of aligned vision and hustling life with the sharp brains ofand.

Here’s why I’m so excited about it: Fuego not only comprehends and adheres to all the important aspects of your brand guidelines to craft high-performing, targeted creatives for you in minutes, but she ALSO helps you create variations for different aspect ratios, with perfect copy and layout variations for A/B testing!

Ship faster. Test faster. Fail/win faster.
Know what works and invest further wisely :)
Fuego's got your back for the basics and smoothly gives you the perfectly editable source files too (without charging you more for it like agencies :P)

Having been in the agency business myself at, I've seen countless creative resources channeled into creating size variations for ads followed by long, tedious approval cycles—both internally and with clients.

Trust me, this laborious activity is a complete waste of the creative talent out there. We're set out to ease this pain by reducing overall production time and increasing ROAS. And the best part? It's cost-effective too! :)

Now performance marketers can truly lead by their pace and up their game to bring results without constraints on the number of creatives they can work with. It's practically a limitless flow now.

Can't wait to dive deeper into industry practices and reshape how it functions with the global landscape as our ever-expanding canvas! 🚀

Actively connecting with D2C founders ready to up their performance marketing game.

"Static Ads Are Making a Comeback!

Yes, you heard me right.

Over the past three months, collaborating with various brands and agencies has revealed an intriguing insight that challenges the current market playbooks.

Our data and performance analysis comparing UGC reels and static ads clearly show a winner.

If you're a brand looking to leverage social media platforms to boost engagement across your funnel, static creatives must be part of your content strategy. Here are three compelling reasons why:

Reel Fatigue: Attention spans are dwindling, and users are becoming more selective about the content they consume. Static ads offer a refreshing change.

Cost and Authenticity Issues with UGC: User-generated content is becoming
increasingly expensive. Users are savvy and can spot a sales pitch a mile away. Brands need to push more authentic data through UGC to stand out.

Message Clarity: Static ads allow brands to convey their message quickly and clearly as users scroll. Well-designed static ads, when intelligently positioned and targeted, drive better results.

And the most crucial reason:

Efficiency in Performance Marketing: Today's performance marketing thrives on rapid iterations and A/B testing. Static ads are cheaper and quicker to produce, allowing performance marketers to experiment more freely and optimize data-backed campaigns for better outcomes.

If you're a marketer, brand owner, content/brand head, or P&L owner, and this resonates with you—or if you have contrarian views—I’d love to hear from you. Static Ads Are Making a Comeback!

"Hey LinkedIn fam, it's been a whirlwind journey at Fuelgrowth.ai lately, and I couldn't wait to share some insights from our founder's desk! 🚀

For the past few months, we've been heads down, laser-focused on crafting cutting-edge solution for larger enterprises. But let me tell you, the journey has been anything but ordinary. We've had countless eye-opening conversations with potential users spanning SMEs to midmarket and enterprises, and the response has been phenomenal! 🌟

Sharing some key takeaways that have been brewing in my mind:

1️⃣ Bold Conversations from Day One: Don't underestimate the power of engaging with enterprise and large organizations right from the get-go. Sometimes, the need for what you're building in these behemoths is far greater than you might anticipate. While SMEs are more accessible for conversations, it's often the big players who truly grasp the value of innovation.

2️⃣ Niche Focus, Stellar Solutions: Conversations with larger enterprises allow you to zero in on a niche and craft state-of-the-art solutions tailored to specific challenges. This focus breeds innovation and sets you apart in the market.

3️⃣ Crystal-Clear Messaging: Engaging with big players forces you to refine your messaging and positioning in the market. Being precise and clear becomes paramount, which ultimately benefits your entire brand identity.

4️⃣ Timing is Key: Navigating enterprise sales cycles, POCs, and sealing those game-changing deals alongside building your product is a marathon, not a sprint. It's crucial to tread carefully, leveraging feedback from fellow operators in the market to ensure your journey is a successful one.

Our journey atis just getting started, and I'm thrilled to embark on this adventure alongside each of you. Let's keep the conversation going! 💬

"Hello Network - any recommendations for a tool which we can use to record and translate our sales and customer success calls ? our team currently uses various sources - mobile, messaging apps, hangouts, zoom, team and others depending on clients ease of use and if we can capture them in our respective CRMs so we have more datapoints to learn and improve the productivity and results. Any recommendations will be super helpful. I came across VOIP apps but they don't solve for this use case yet.

All founders, sales, revenue and customer success leaders how are you solving this problem in your organisation ? Would love to hear some feedback from the community.
