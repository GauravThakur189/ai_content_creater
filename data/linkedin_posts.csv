"This week, our CEO stepped down and we replaced him with AI

Except, it was an April Fool‚Äôs prank.

You‚Äôve probably seen the videoposted where he announces he‚Äôs stepping down and being replaced by our AI CEO, Jaspar 2.0

(If not, definitely check it out here:)

While many people thought the whole thing was AI generated, it was in fact 100% human made

We hired an entire film crew, rented a mansion and casted our AI CEO,(who is a really human, even if he does look totally AI-generated)

We were up against a lot of constraints:

Timeline = under 3 weeks
Budget = less than $20k
Experience = none, apart from one film class I took in 11th grade

(For reference, when we enquired creative agencies, one said it would be $100k+ and they needed at least 3 months to execute it)

We had zero film experience and an impossibly tight turnaround time...

But we ended up delivering a pretty amazing (if I do say so myself) campaign that drove 100,000+ impressions for Artisan

Jaspar even got a few real job offers!

If you're curious how we pulled it off, I wrote a blog breaking down everything here:

Proof that anything‚Äôs possible when you decide it is.

Not to mention a truly exceptional customer experience. Way to do it! We're fans! Jaspar Carmichael-Jack The most successful outbound sales campaigns don't pitch a product. At least, not right away

Our CS team has been working with 100s of customers using Artisan and have found that across the board, the top-performing campaigns are the ones that prioritize building a relationship with prospects, above all else

Our CSMs comes from top lead generation agencies and brings years of hands-on experience creating outbound campaigns for clients - we want to set all of our users up for the best chance of success

And what they've found is one tactic that works really well is withholding the sell until the second or third message. Make the first message about offering the prospect something they want

A great example of this is hpy, a mental health platform designed to enhance the therapy experience. After testing a bunch of different outbound approaches, the campaign that outperformed all others was one inviting therapists to be guests on their podcast

In fact, they received so many high quality responses that they're struggling to keep up with demand!

"We got to ~$3M ARR in 5 months with our AI BDR. Here‚Äôs how. 

I‚Äôve said before that winning as a startup comes down to 2 things:

1. Product
2. Distribution

We started with a pretty terrible strategy for both‚Ä¶

Our first product sucked - we followed the YC methodology of launching early and iterating. Our MVP didn‚Äôt work, the UI was terrible and features were lacking heavily

Though this was a painful process, it enabled us to iterate and build faster than we would have otherwise

We also had no brand awareness, no SEO and no GTM strategy (as you‚Äôd expect for a pre-seed startup)

We started with product-led growth, which was a terrible model for us ‚Äì users never finished onboarding, our ACV was too low, the time-to-value was too long, etc

Think hard about whether product-led is right for you or if you should be doing sales-led

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

We rebuilt our entire strategy to hit $3m ARR in a few months

Product:

We rebuilt everything and launched V2 of our AI BDR, Ava, in May. The relaunch had a completely new UI and features our users had been asking for. We did 100s of user interviews to understand what our users wanted, and built:

- Live lead research across LinkedIn, X, news and the web to create hyper-personalized emails and LI messages

- New data sources to complement our B2B data including E-Commerce and Local Business Data

- Magic Campaigns, so Ava can create your campaign messaging for you
+ much more

We‚Äôre working on a huge release for V4 of Artisan in Q1, so stay tuned ü¶Ñ

Distribution:

We built an extremely robust GTM strategy, spanning:

- A comprehensive outbound strategy using Ava, our AI BDR
- Our SF ‚ÄúStop Hiring Humans‚Äù billboard campaign
- Our TechCrunch Disrupt sponsorship
- Ramped up SEO efforts
- Funding announcements combined with big brand pushes

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

We‚Äôre now consistently closing ~$1M of ARR every month and will continue to double down our efforts on building the best product on the market & maintaining our position as a market leader in AI Sales & AI Employees

We have some VERY exciting new products beyond just outbound coming early next year ü§ì

"In 3 years there will be no human BDRs.

Ok maybe that's slightly dramatic but there will be significantly less. The role of a BDR has become increasingly automated, but until now, no technology could fully replicate what a human can do. That‚Äôs about to change

I've chatted with 100s of BDRs who are excited about Artisan. No BDRs actually want to be BDRs - they want to build human relationships in an AE role

And companies are ready to spend less on their BDR org. For reference, Ava (our AI BDR) costs 90%+ less than the equivalent human output

Traditionally, the BDR role consists of a series of extremely manual tasks:

Build a list of contacts from a B2B data provider
Verify their contact info
Look for personalizations across their LinkedIn, X, news, etc
Prospect through channels like email, phone, or social media
Follow up
Respond to objections
Book in meetings
Update CRM

Automation has been slowly eating away at the BDR‚Äôs role for a long time and we're approaching a fully autonomous AI BDR. By 2025, AI BDRs will be list building, prospecting, qualifying over the phone, objection handling, booking meetings, taking notes, and updating CRMs autonomously

Ava already automates 80% of a BDRs role, finding leads, collecting data on from dozens of sources to effectively personalize emails and LinkedIn messages at scale, and managing deliverability

"Your first 5 hires at a startup determine whether it lives or dies. Here are the first hires we made at Artisan that put us on the path to $1M ARR:

1. Engineer
2. Engineer
3. Product Manager
4. Product Designer
5. Chief of Staff

Here‚Äôs how each hire played a fundamental role in getting us from 0 to 1:

1 & 2.  Engineer:

Our first product is all-in-one outbound sales platform that consolidates 10s of tools and contains an AI BDR. We couldn‚Äôt build that with just one person ‚Äì we needed more manpower

The first hires we made were engineers (one FE, one BE) and they were instrumental in building our MVP

3. Product Manager:

We‚Äôve always been product obsessed, and every feature we create needs to be 10x better than existing solutions

To help us ensure this, we hired a PM who eventually became my co-founder, Sam!

4. Product Designer:

Most B2B software looks tired We want to create B2B SaaS that feels like using a consumer app

The UI of our MVP was terrible when we first launched it, and we realized how important it was to have a great interface so customers would actually enjoy using the product

We hired a Product Designer so we could create the best UI of any AI SDR tool on the market ‚Äì and it has made a fundamental difference to our users‚Äô experience

5. Chief of Staff:

Most startups don‚Äôt hire a CoS until post Series A. But the value you get from hiring a talented generalist that can do everything is extremely underrated

My CoS Tina was able to take full days of sales calls, create really strong content for our marketing channels & help with hiring demands and expanding our existing team

Now that we‚Äôve hit $1M and are shifting focus to scaling existing processes, we‚Äôre looking to hire more drivers (especially engineers) to help us scale to $10M and beyond

Building the right team has enabled us to build the best AI SDR. We have the most comprehensive data, wide-reaching set of features, best personalizations, and an unparalleled user experience

We hired a Product Designer so we could create the best UI of any AI SDR tool on the market ‚Äì and it has made a fundamental difference to our users‚Äô experience

5. Chief of Staff:

Most startups don‚Äôt hire a CoS until post Series A. But the value you get from hiring a talented generalist that can do everything is extremely underrated

My CoS Tina was able to take full days of sales calls, create really strong content for our marketing channels & help with hiring demands and expanding our existing team

Now that we‚Äôve hit $1M and are shifting focus to scaling existing processes, we‚Äôre looking to hire more drivers (especially engineers) to help us scale to $10M and beyond

Building the right team has enabled us to build the best AI SDR. We have the most comprehensive data, wide-reaching set of features, best personalizations, and an unparalleled user experience

"Artisan has just closed over $700k of ARR in 2 months. This is how I joined the founding team of a hyper-growth startup, without any relevant experience.

I spent a year applying to tech startups without getting any interviews or responses. I knew AI was a field I wanted to go into, but had no idea where to start. I only had ~1 year of experience working in PR, which would hardly make me stand out in a sea of applicants.

Here's what I did in that year, which finally landed me the CoS role at Artisan:

1. Created a list of AI startups that were fast growth, recently raised funding. I checked their job listings religiously.

2. Went to local networking events for founders and startups.

3. Checked the YC job board daily.

4. Used AI in every part of my life and read up on it constantly.

5. Reached out to people I thought were interesting on LinkedIn for coffee chats & insights into the industry.

6. Applied to every open listing that I was remotely interested in.

In December 2023, I got an interview with ElevenLabs. It was the first sign since I started my job hunt that someone was interested. The interviews went well, but as a Series A company, they were looking for someone with way more experience. I was crushed.

In January, I applied tovia their careers form (), not expecting to hear back. The next day,messaged me to chat.

Here's what I did during the interview process that landed me the job:

1. Phrased my background to justify every step of my journey. I studied English at Oxford (talent for storytelling), went into PR (business operations interest), then moved from healthcare to tech (wanted to contribute to tech's global impact).

2. Was extremely responsive & hard working. I left Saturday plans early for a follow-up interview, spent all of Sunday on my interview task, and worked trial evenings until 12am, after my usual 9 to 5.

3. Excelled at a tough task. Because I lacked experience, I was given a mammoth task to create a website strategy for Artisan's next product launch. I had no idea where to start. GPT was my consultant through the whole process, helping me create a framework from which to work from.

4. Showed confidence in the value I COULD bring, despite my non-traditional background.

Experience shouldn't matter in hiring. Look for intelligence, resourcefulness, scrappiness - qualities for thriving in fast-paced environments. Artisan took a chance on me, which paid off through my rapid growth and dedication.

Build these qualities:
- Resourcefulness
- An insane work ethic
- Perseverance
- Confidence in your value

and you'll catch someone's eye soon.

"We've closed ~$700k of ARR within 2 months as a seed stage startup.

Most startups fail at our stage because they can‚Äôt build enough traction to sustain long-term growth.

Why?

Traditional growth channels are dying - startups are burning cash, time, and morale by chasing ghosts.

We've cracked the code by building a lead gen machine that delivers ~50 qualified leads every day.

Here's how we did it:

1. Building a product that people want

It doesn't matter how great your marketing is - if no one needs/wants what you're building, you won't close any deals

We ask the right questions in user interviews & sales calls, and feed those insights directly to our roadmap. Our AI BDR Ava is 1% of what our future product is going to be

2. Creating engaging content on LinkedIn

Founder and thought leadership content is our secret weapon

Sharing our journey & wins is a huge channel for us. It's gotten us 1000s of leads and 10s of investors

Awareness spreads like wildfire (and it‚Äôs completely free)

3. Using Ava, our own outbound engine

A strong flow of leads are generated by our AI BDR product, Ava

In-depth personalization is key for getting responses from leads, and we're launching a huge update to take this to the next level in a few weeks - learn more about Ava at

4. Tapping into the YC network

We're the leading outbound product in the YC ecosystem, and have YC companies turning to us every day to support building their outbound demand generation engine. If you're an early-stage founder with a B2B product with category-leading potential, apply to YC

5. Exploring a number of GTM channels

We've tested too many GTM channels to list here (SEO, blog content, influencer, press, events, etc) and have learned a lot about what works/doesn't work for early stage B2B SaaS companies. If you want me to send you a breakdown of our analysis of different channels, leave a comment below

Great content + diversity of GTM channels + amazing product = Startup growth on steroids.

Our approach proves that with the right strategy, seed-stage startups can achieve remarkable results in a short time. We've closed ~$700k of ARR within 2 months as a seed stage startup.

"Are AI SDRs able to replace humans yet?

At Artisan we think it'll happen soon. But what's definitely true is that your human SDRs are burning out, missing quotas, and costing you a fortune. Meanwhile, AI SDRs are working 24/7, never complaining, and delivering hot leads directly into your inbox.

Facts:
- Only 17% of human reps hit 90%+ of quota
- AI SDRs can automate 80% of outbound tasks
- They're scalable, consistent, and way cheaper than a human

Imagine your top performers freed from grunt work, focusing solely on high-value interactions. That's not the future - it's happening now. Your competition is already using AI to flood their pipeline while you're stuck in the stone age, too scared to take a risk.

It's time to adapt. Or explain to your board why you're hemorrhaging market share to companies embracing the AI revolution. The choice is yours.

"The lead drought is real and it's killing sales teams everywhere. Except ours.

We're flooded with sales inquiries while other companies struggle to find qualified leads.

Why? Because Artisan and our AI BDR Ava are specifically designed to pour fuel on PMF. Artisan is an out-of-the-box outbound machine.

Current tools are terrible ‚Äì they‚Äôre a total waste of time and money. They promise the moon but deliver nothing but headaches and empty pipelines. Sales teams are burning out chasing dead-end leads and wasting precious hours on ‚Äúcutting-edge‚Äù platforms that can't even get basic contact info right.

Our solution isn't just another shiny AI tool ‚Äì it's a game-changer that's delivering real results. Our customers are seeing real ROI and their sales teams are actually excited to come to work again.

Don't believe us? Book a meeting with our sales team and speak with one of us directly. We‚Äôll show you why our AI BDR & consolidated outbound platform are the most functional and effective on the market. The lead drought is real and it's killing sales teams everywhere. Except ours.
